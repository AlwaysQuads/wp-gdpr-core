The plugin gives you advice on how to be compliant with GDPR and witch actions you need to take in order to be compliant.


== Description ==
The plugin will create a page where users can request access to their personal data, stored on your website.
In the backend you'll get an overview of the requests users send and you can see which plugins collect personal data and need a 'ask for approval' checkbox.

In a fist stage users who ask to view their personal data will get an email with a unique url on which they can view their comments and ask for a removal per comment.
When they ask for a removal, the admin has the ability to delete the comment through the wp-gdpr backend.
All emails will be send automatically.

In the second stage they can view, update and download their personal data or ask for a removal and this for WP Comments and Contact Form 7 CFDB7.

In the third stage they can view, update and download their personal data or ask for a removal and this for Gravity Forms, Mailchimp, Woocommerce, The events calendar and Events manager.
